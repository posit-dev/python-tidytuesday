### An extra TidyTuesday challenge  

If you **didn't** get here via [the official TidyTuesday github repo](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), we encourage you to go check it out first. It's a weekly data science challenge run by the [Data Science Learning Community](https://dslc.io/), with a new data set added each week. 

This repository is your destination for an added challenge. Inside the readme file of each week's TidyTuesday data set, you'll see one of our challenge questions. To participate, just tackle that challenge, share your result to your community of choice, and don't forget to tag us using the hastags #TidyTuesday and #PositPythonChallenge so that we can highlight your work! <!-- TODO: what is our hashtag going to be? -->

### Here's where you can tag us when you share your submissions!
